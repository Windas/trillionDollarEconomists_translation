# Matchmaker, Matchmaker

At a fundamental level, economics is about resource allocation, or who gets what? Mainstream introductory textbooks suggest that prices play a critical role in the answer. Those willing and able to pay the going price for goods and services sold in the market get what suppliers make available. In competitive markets, this outcome is said to be efficient.

However, there are many examples of markets where price is not the governing factor in decisions, if prices exist at all. Consider some of the most important decisions people make: where to go to college, which job to choose, or which person to marry. Price is important in two of these cases, bu not in the third, and even in the first two, price is often or generally not the most important factor in the decision.

So how do these nontraditional markets work, where matches may be made based on a certain set of rules and characteristics that are unique to each setting? Answering that question is the subject of this chapter, in which I introduce you to a new branch of economics called market design, a field devoted to making markets work more efficiently by better matching supply with demand.

I will begin with a brief and gentle introduction to the economics of matchmaking. I then discuss two major applications of market design and matching theory in the real world, including one where business is clearly at stake (the job market) and the other where the Internet has enabled much larger businesses to develop, such as the dating market. I conclude with some bottom line observations.

Unlike the subject of the last chapter, where economists and businesses using experiments developed more or less in parallel, there has been considerable cross-fertilization among economists and businesses in the world of matchmaking. Given the stories you are about to read, I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot more such cooperation in the years ahead.

### A Gentle Introduction to Market Design and matching Theory

Matching is one of the most fundamental functions of markets. As we have seen in previous chapters, prices are the matchmakers in traditional markets. Indeed, Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, marveled at the way consumers and firms operated in a market economy and responded to prices, action as if guided by an invisible hand that leads markets to allocate resources efficiently. All of this you will find in any standard economics textbook.

A new field of economics, not yet found in most introductory or even intermediate-level economics textbooks, is developing. That field is market design, which recognizes that well-functioning markets depend on detailed rules. For example, supply and demand drive both the housing market and the job market, but someone who wats to buy or sell a house goes through similar but also some very different steps than those taken by job seekers or emplyers. Market designers try to understand the specific rules, characterstics, and culture of each market in order to fix them when they're broken, or to build markets from scratch when they're missing.

Think of market designers as the engineers of economics. Just as civil engineers apply principles of physics and mechanics to design bridges, market designers apply the principles of economic analysis--competition, incentives, information, economies of scale--to design exchage mechanisms or improve existing markets.

Matching theory essentially comes from two subfields of economics: game theory--the study of strategic behavior, in which particular rules and market characteristics play an important role in an outcome--and experimental economics, which is about conducting empirical work and testing theories in the real world.

To understand the field of market design and the economics of matchmaking, remember the discussion in Chapter 2 about how traditional markets can fail, or why markets for certain goods or services are sometimes missing in the first placeL where there are externalities, information asymmetries (one party knows more than the other about a particular product or service), or public goods. A classic example is pollution, which imposes costs on third parties and therefore leads to overproduction when the producer does not internalize these environmental costs. Sometimes, the private market can solve these problems (if the polluters and those affected by it are small in number and thus can negotiate a solution), and in other cases, the government is better suited to provide remedies, which include taxes, subsidies, and regulation.

In the context of market design, market failure refers primarily to the specific rules (or lack thereof) and characteristics of markets that sometimes impede efficient matching. In particular, there are three kinds of market failure that the market designers study:

1. Markets can fail to provide *thickness*, or to bring together enough buyers and sellers to transct with each other to make a real marke.
2. Markets can fail to overcome congestion, or to provide participants with enough time, or with the means to conduct transactions fast enough to make satisfactory choices when faced with many alternatives.
3. Markets can fail to make it *safe* for participants to reveal or act on confidential information they may hold.

The primary motive for economists interested in improvig market design is to cerrect hese market failures, and more broadly, to make markets work more efficiently by better mathcing individual suppliers with purchasers or those on the demand side of transactions. As such, market designers are interested in improving both traditional markets governed by a price mechanism and nontraditional markets, where the scace goods to be allocated are heterogeneous and indivisible and prices may not be key to reconciling supply and demand. Examples of the latter include which students go to certain schools, which workers get specific jobs, and who receives which transplantable organ.

Many of the examples we will explore in this chapter involve nontraditional markets, but it is also useful to briefly consider the ways in which market designers can improve traditional markets that are governed by a price mechanism. Take auctions and online marketplaces, discussed in Chapter 3, for example. While in theory it seems straightforward that byyers and sellers in these settings would arrive at an efficient outcome, in practice it is actually very difficult to present buyers and sellers with only the markets and products or services they are interested in. That is, while it is easy to provide a platform to draw participants to a marketplace, there are numerous inefficiencies that arise when buyers and sellers cannot find the relevant products or services, either due to information asymmetries, congestion, or a lack of thickness. In these situations, market makers can improve price-driven markets by better matching supply and demand in accordance with the rules and insitutional culture of each market.

Two of the pioneers of market design and matching theory are Lloyd Shapley and Alvin Roth, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2012. The Nobel committee recognized Shapley's and Roth's extensive work across a multitude of disciplines and settings, from abstract theory developed in the 1950s and 1960s by Shapley on stable matching to the empirical and practical work conducted by Roth since the early 1980s (see the following boxes for brief overviews of the work of each economist).

> ### Lloyd Shapley
Lloyd Shapley, like a number of Nelbel Prize winners in economics, did not get his formal training in the subject. Nonetheless, during the courseof his career, he make significant contributions to game theory, market design,and matching theory, and was recognized by the Nobel committee in 2012 (along with Alvin Roth) for the importance of this work.

> Shapley was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1923 and enrolled at Harvard University in the early 1940s, but couldn't compeletehis degree, because like many other young men at the time, he was drafted and served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1945. Shapley returned to Harvard after the war and graduated with a degree in mathematics in 1948. He then worked as a research mathematician at th RAND Corporation before going to princeton University to obtain his PhD in mathematics. While there, he mentored and befriended John Nash, a fellow future Nobel laureate, and the protagonist inthe bok and movie *A Beautiful Mind*. Shapley can even be credited with that title when he described Nash as having a "keen, beautiful, and logical mind."

> At Princeton, Shapley's major contribution to game theory was his introduction of what has come to be known as a Shapley value--a payoff derived from a set of axioms applicable to every cooperative game. The value and related measures of it have been widely applied in numerous settings over time. including in the quantification of the impact of voting rules on the influence of individual voters, in legal decisions concerning electoral districting and representation, and in accounting problems of cost allocation.

> Shapley also make some of the earliest and most important theoretical contributions in mathcing heory. In a seminar paper he coauthored in 1962 with David Gale, Shapley explored the idea of stable matching--allocations where no individuals perceive any gains from further trade. In the paper, titled "College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage," Shapley and Gale presented a model of a two-sided matching in which men and women--or students adn colleges--expressed preferences for their mathes. In particular, Shapley and Gale proposed a deferred-acceptance algorithm (since known as the Gale-Shapley algorithm) for finding stable matching, for instance, where no couples would break up and form new mathes that would make them better off.

> Since 1981, Shpaley has been affiliated with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he is currently professor emeritus.

One of the primary distinctions market designers make when analyzing markets is that of centralization versus decentralization. Some markets have centralized clearinghouses that match supply and demand (even if prices are absent). Other markets are decentralized and do not have a central authority to allocate resources.

For example, consider the market for medical residents, with hospitals on the demand side and new doctors (residents) on the supply side. In the early twentieth century, medical students would apply for positions in hospitals during their final year of medical school. However, as competition for new doctors increased, by the 1940s hospitals began hiring students much earlier than before—often almost two years before graduation. Due to the uncertainty and insufficient information about medical students' plans of where they wanted to work two years later, as well as the lack of viable alternatives that were available to each student, the market began to lose thickness over time.

By the 1950s, hospitals and medical organizations addressed this problem by establishing rules concerning when offers could be made. That soon led to congestion because hospitals were not giving medical students enough time to make decisions. To solve this problem, medical groups organized a centralized clearinghouse to better match supply with demand called the National Resident Matching Program (NR.MP), which is still in use today and is a version that Alvin Roth redesigned in the 1990s to improve its efficiency (see box on Alvin Roth later). 

As the NRMP example demonstrates, introducing a centralized clearinghouse can improve a market that previously, in the words of market designers, could unravel, and fail to produce an efficient outcome. This solution raises a question, however: Can all decentralized markets be made more efficient by introducing a centralized clearinghouse to match supply with demand?

According to Clayton Featherstone, a former post-doctoral fellow who was mentored by Roth at Harvard Business School and who now conducts research in market design and matching theory at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, the potential gains of having a centralized clearinghouse must be weighed carefully against the potential gains of having numerous smaller exchanges compete with each other for market participants.15 As always with market design, details matter; so it depends on the market in question.

For example, as we will see below in the dating market, there are currently several dozen viable dating websites available to individuals, each offering a different interface and user experience, with some catering to very specialized audiences. This is a case where the net benefits of a single clearinghouse are not sufficient to justify the costs.

There is a good counterexample, however, and it is the market for kidneys. This is a market that Roth has thought a lot about and has helped to greatly improve in the past few years. In the United States, as in many other countries, commercial trade in human organs is illegal, mostly for ethical reasons, which is why the market for kidneys is some times described as a repugnant market. Kidneys therefore are allocated in the United States through a donation system that matches patients with donors. There are currently about 70,000 patients in need of a kidney transplant, yet only about 11,000 a year receive them.

Since people are born with two kidneys and can live healthy lives with just one, a person can donate a kidney to someone in need. However, since the patient and donor may be incompatible (because of differences in their blood types, for example), they would have to locate another such pair in which the donor in one pair could donate a kidney to the patient in the other pair, and vice versa. Up until the early 2000s, these so-called paired exchanges were rare because it was difficult for people to locate compatible patient-donor pairs.

In this situation, then, it is clear that the market lacks thickness and would benefit from having a centralized kidney exchange to bring together more compatible donor pairs and thereby permit the trans- plantation of many more kidneys. Roth and his colleagues M. Utku Unver and Tayfun Sonmez argued exactly this point in a 2004 article. Kidney surgeons in New England were receptive to the idea and, with the help of Roth and his colleagues, the 14 kidney transplant centers in that area were brought together to create the New England Program for Kidney Exchange. Roth believes there is a substantial business opportunity for someone to organize a single, national kidney (and other organ) clearinghouse. In fact, Congress has established a national pilot program for kidney exchanges that is being operated as a nonprofit organization (like the New England organization). Kidney transplants not only offer vastly greater quality of life for patients than dialysis, but also save money; •by one good estimate, $60,000 per Medicare beneficiary.

Where there are cost advantages to a single clearinghouse, such as in the market for kidneys, economists cite this as evidence of economies of scale. With kidneys, what matters is that the number of patient-donor matches is maximized. However, as we will see in the example of dating websites, there is more room in that setting for product differentiation and, indeed, that is partly what has contributed to that market's decentralization, which ends up benefiting consumers because greater competition leads to the differentiation that consumers want.

> ### Alvin Roth
Alvin Roth is one of the pioneers of market design and has made significant contributions to matching theory, game theory, and experimental economics. Born in New -York City in 1951, Roth went to high school in Queens, where he dropped out in his junior year and began taking weekend engineering classes at Columbia University2' After a professor there suggested that he apply to college, Roth was admitted formally to Columbia and graduated with a degree in engineering in 1971. He went to Stanford University to complete his graduate work, receiving both his masters and PhD in a branch of engineering called operations research, which uses mathematics to improve decision making, often in the face of uncertainty (see Chapter 4, which discusses this field in greater detail).

> Roth has taught at multiple universities--the University of Illinois, the University of Pittsburgh, Harvard, and Stanford--applying his training in operations research to explore topics in game theory including market design and matching theory.

> In the early 1980s, Roth recognized the real-world relevance of the Gale-Shapley algorithm(explained in the box on Lloyd Shapley, earlier). In particular, in 1984 Roth studied the algorithm used by the NRMP clearinghouse to match new doctors with hospitals and discovered that it was closely related to the Gale-Shapley algorithm proposed decades earlier. By the 1990s, there were signs that the NRMP clearinghouse was encountering problems. As the number of female medical students grew over the preceding decades, dual-doctor couples were often looking for work in the same region, and this presented a challenge to the system: Many new doctors were no longer using it, a sign that it was not producing stable matches. In 1995, Roth was asked to redesign the system and modernize it to produce stable matches and improve its efficiency. The new algorithm, which he designed with Elliott Peranson, was adopted by NRJV1P in 1997 and is still in use today.

> In recent years, Roth has applied the Gale-Shapley algorithm in a variety of other settings. In 2003, for example, Roth helped to design New York City's public high school matching system. Before 2003, the city's allocated spots through a complicated process that involved repeated rounds of applications and rejections, resulting in tens of thousands of unstable matches every year. The new algorithm that Roth implemented, based on the theoretical work of Gale and Shapley, resulted in a 90 percent reduction in the number of unstable matches. Today a growing number of school systems, including Boston's, have begun to apply Roth's techniques to improve their matching mechanisms.

> Another significant contribution by Roth to market design and matching theory is the market for kidney donors and patients, as discussed in the text. Roth's most recent projects include helping redesign the job markets for gastroenterologists and economists, and setting up a nationwide kidney exchange, which would provide far more thickness and stable matches than any of the existing regional clearinghouses.

> As is evident from the multitude of diverse applications of his work, Roth is a pioneer of applying sophisticated economic theories to solve practical problems. For his contributions to market design and matching theory, Roth was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2012 (along with Lloyd Shapley) and remains active in field experiments to this day as a professor of economics at Stanford University and emeritus professor of business administration at Harvard Business School.
