# Matchmaker, Matchmaker

At a fundamental level, economics is about resource allocation, or who gets what? Mainstream introductory textbooks suggest that prices play a critical role in the answer. Those willing and able to pay the going price for goods and services sold in the market get what suppliers make available. In competitive markets, this outcome is said to be efficient.

However, there are many examples of markets where price is not the governing factor in decisions, if prices exist at all. Consider some of the most important decisions people make: where to go to college, which job to choose, or which person to marry. Price is important in two of these cases, bu not in the third, and even in the first two, price is often or generally not the most important factor in the decision.

So how do these nontraditional markets work, where matches may be made based on a certain set of rules and characteristics that are unique to each setting? Answering that question is the subject of this chapter, in which I introduce you to a new branch of economics called market design, a field devoted to making markets work more efficiently by better matching supply with demand.

I will begin with a brief and gentle introduction to the economics of matchmaking. I then discuss two major applications of market design and matching theory in the real world, including one where business is clearly at stake (the job market) and the other where the Internet has enabled much larger businesses to develop, such as the dating market. I conclude with some bottom line observations.

Unlike the subject of the last chapter, where economists and businesses using experiments developed more or less in parallel, there has been considerable cross-fertilization among economists and businesses in the world of matchmaking. Given the stories you are about to read, I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot more such cooperation in the years ahead.

### A Gentle Introduction to Market Design and matching Theory

Matching is one of the most fundamental functions of markets. As we have seen in previous chapters, prices are the matchmakers in traditional markets. Indeed, Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, marveled at the way consumers and firms operated in a market economy and responded to prices, action as if guided by an invisible hand that leads markets to allocate resources efficiently. All of this you will find in any standard economics textbook.

A new field of economics, not yet found in most introductory or even intermediate-level economics textbooks, is developing. That field is market design, which recognizes that well-functioning markets depend on detailed rules. For example, supply and demand drive both the housing market and the job market, but someone who wats to buy or sell a house goes through similar but also some very different steps than those taken by job seekers or emplyers. Market designers try to understand the specific rules, characterstics, and culture of each market in order to fix them when they're broken, or to build markets from scratch when they're missing.

Think of market designers as the engineers of economics. Just as civil engineers apply principles of physics and mechanics to design bridges, market designers apply the principles of economic analysis--competition, incentives, information, economies of scale--to design exchage mechanisms or improve existing markets.

Matching theory essentially comes from two subfields of economics: game theory--the study of strategic behavior, in which particular rules and market characteristics play an important role in an outcome--and experimental economics, which is about conducting empirical work and testing theories in the real world.

To understand the field of market design and the economics of matchmaking, remember the discussion in Chapter 2 about how traditional markets can fail, or why markets for certain goods or services are sometimes missing in the first placeL where there are externalities, information asymmetries (one party knows more than the other about a particular product or service), or public goods. A classic example is pollution, which imposes costs on third parties and therefore leads to overproduction when the producer does not internalize these environmental costs. Sometimes, the private market can solve these problems (if the polluters and those affected by it are small in number and thus can negotiate a solution), and in other cases, the government is better suited to provide remedies, which include taxes, subsidies, and regulation.

In the context of market design, market failure refers primarily to the specific rules (or lack thereof) and characteristics of markets that sometimes impede efficient matching. In particular, there are three kinds of market failure that the market designers study:

1. Markets can fail to provide *thickness*, or to bring together enough buyers and sellers to transct with each other to make a real marke.
2. Markets can fail to overcome congestion, or to provide participants with enough time, or with the means to conduct transactions fast enough to make satisfactory choices when faced with many alternatives.
3. Markets can fail to make it *safe* for participants to reveal or act on confidential information they may hold.

The primary motive for economists interested in improvig market design is to cerrect hese market failures, and more broadly, to make markets work more efficiently by better mathcing individual suppliers with purchasers or those on the demand side of transactions. As such, market designers are interested in improving both traditional markets governed by a price mechanism and nontraditional markets, where the scace goods to be allocated are heterogeneous and indivisible and prices may not be key to reconciling supply and demand. Examples of the latter include which students go to certain schools, which workers get specific jobs, and who receives which transplantable organ.

> ### Lloyd Shapley
Lloyd Shapley, like a number of Nelbel Prize winners in economics, did not get his formal training in the subject. Nonetheless, during the courseof his career, he make significant contributions to game theory, market design,and matching theory, and was recognized by the Nobel committee in 2012 (along with Alvin Roth) for the importance of this work.

> Shapley was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1923 and enrolled at Harvard University in the early 1940s, but couldn't compeletehis degree, because like many other young men at the time, he was drafted and served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1945. Shapley returned to Harvard after the war and graduated with a degree in mathematics in 1948. He then worked as a research mathematician at th RAND Corporation before going to princeton University to obtain his PhD in mathematics. While there, he mentored and befriended John Nash, a fellow future Nobel laureate, and the protagonist inthe bok and movie *A Beautiful Mind*. Shapley can even be credited with that title when he described Nash as having a "keen, beautiful, and logical mind."

> At Princeton, Shapley's major contribution to game theory was his introduction of what has come to be known as a Shapley value--a payoff derived from a set of axioms applicable to every cooperative game. The value and related measures of it have been widely applied in numerous settings over time. including in the quantification of the impact of voting rules on the influence of individual voters, in legal decisions concerning electoral districting and representation, and in accounting problems of cost allocation.

> Shapley also make some of the earliest and most important theoretical contributions in mathcing heory. In a seminar paper he coauthored in 1962 with David Gale, Shapley explored the idea of stable matching--allocations where no individuals perceive any gains from further trade. In the paper, titled "College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage," Shapley and Gale presented a model of a two-sided matching in which men and women--or students adn colleges--expressed preferences for their mathes. In particular, Shapley and Gale proposed a deferred-acceptance algorithm (since known as the Gale-Shapley algorithm) for finding stable matching, for instance, where no couples would break up and form new mathes that would make them better off.

> Since 1981, Shpaley has been affiliated with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he is currently professor emeritus.

For example, as we will see below in the dating market, there are currently several dozen viable dating websites available to individuals, each offering a different interface and user experience, with some catering to very specialized audiences. This is a case where the net benefits of a single clearinghouse are not sufficient to justify the costs.
