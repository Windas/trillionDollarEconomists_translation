#Economists and Mostly Good Financial Engineering

  &emsp;We now come to the chapter about economists and finance. Given the bad reputation that the subject has earned in the wake of the financial crisis, l purposely delayed discussing it until l've put you in a better mood.
  
  &emsp;Seriously, economists, or actually financial economists, have made major contributions to our understanding of the way not only how the financial sector works, but also how the overall economy operates. Modern economies would not exit without modern financial sectors and systems, for finance is the lifeblood of all economies. When it works as it is supposed to, financial institutions and markets are not just abstract middleman, but essential institutions that enable people and firms to save and diversify their wealth. Just as clogged arteries and malfunctioning hearts can debilitate or kill people, finance gone wrong can do the sanmeto economies. That is why financial engineering , in some quarters, no longer has the desirable connotations it once did. As an aside, most of those innovations that turned out wrong were not invented by economists, although many economists, including some famous and important ones, were late in realizing percisely how wrong they turned out to be.
  
  &emsp;In Chapter 12, l discuss a few ways in which economists have contributed to policy measures that have provided the platforms that have enabled or encouraged certain financial innovations or practices which l believe had positive economic effects.
  
  &emsp;This chapter is not about policy, however, but about financially related economic ideas that collectively have had major business implications. I will concentrate on three of the most improtant ones, as well as on the economists who thought them up, and a few of the business visionaries who put them to profitable, socially productive uses.
  

#Not Putting Your Eggs in One Basket:The Rise of Index Inversting

  &emsp;If there is one adage that many investors have been told by their financial advisers, or by many books on investing, it is "Don't put all your eggs into one basket." In other words, do your best to diversify. True, this won't make you a killing, unless you make a lot of money from some other endeavor, save a lot of it, and then put that money into a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and some alternative assets (like real estate, or even gold). Then the laws of compound interest will take over, and if you live long enough, your wealth will be substantial.
  
  &emsp;There is a competing investment philosophy that is diametrically opposed to this bit of conventional wisdom. Attributed to a wide number of people, one of whom was Andrew Carnegie, the founder of U.S. Steel (Once a mighty industrial powerhouse), this notion is to concentrate on only one investment, and then watch that particular "basket" very carefully. I have heard this quote from some businessmen before, and frankly, it strikes me as much better advice for people engaged in business than those deciding how to invest someone's money.
  
  &emsp;Business calls for single-minded focus on what a firm and its employees do best. The national analogue to this notion is the principleof comparative advantage, probably one of the least understood and yet most important insights from economics. This principle says that nations (or firms or people) are best off if they concentrate on what they do best compared to others, even if they are absolutely better at doing a lot of things than others. The principle implies that businesses are thus better off if they are focused on just one or a few things.
  
  &emsp;Investing is different. One can earn more and take less risk overall bu diversifying. But what is the optimal amount of diversification? That was a question that Harry Markowitz asked in the earlier 1950s. His answer, roughly 20 to 30 stocks, and the methodology he used to derive it, earned him a Nobel Prize in 1990. Several years earlier, in 1981, Yale economist James Tobin (One of my graduate school mentors and favorite teachers and people) also won the Nobel Prize for related work.
  
  &emsp;Some ideas win Nobel Prizes whlie others become popularized, either by journalists or other economists. The notion that portfolio diversification is the best way to invest in the market provides such an example. When investors think of the concept, the individual who most often comes to mind is neither Markowitz nor Tobin, but longtime Princeton economics professor and frequent op-ed columnist Burton Malkiel, who penned one of the most famous popular books about investing, *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*. Originally published in 1973, the book has since had 10 editions.<sup>1</sup>
  
  &emsp;Ideas can have real-world commercial impacts in many different ways. Sometimes, entrepreneurs and executives at established firms read a book or an article with a clever idea and they proceed to make it operational. Others get commercial ideas from economists they hires as consultants. And frequently, as you will see in this book, entrepreneurs are motivated by an economic idea they learn while attending school.
  
  &emsp;John "Jack" Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard family of mutual funds, is a prime example of the last way economists have had an impact. Bogle reports that he was heavily influenced by both Malkiel and Paul Samuelson (profiled in Chapter 2), two of the champions of indexing and critics of active money management, especiallybu individual investors, both in writing his senior thesis at Princetion on the idea of index fund and then actually implementing that idea at Vanguard.<sup>2</sup>In 1976, the firm launched its S&P index fund, shortly after Malkiel published his first edition of *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*.

  &emsp;The rest, as they say, is history. Not only did Vanguard go on to sponsor funds based on other indices, but other funds copied Vanguard's model and did the same and then some. Eventually, numerous mutual funds offered all kinds of sector-specific funds, each with its own index.
  
  &emsp;It is difficult to overstate the important of the indexing revolution in the mutual fund business, which up tp Bogle's time operated entirely through funds that were actively managed bu stock pickers, and accordingly charged comparatively larger management fees (typically 1 percent or more of the assets of the fund each year) than index funds (where the fees tend to fall in the range of 10 to 20 basis points, or 0.1 to 0.2 percent of assets). Bogle has shown in his extensive writings how this difference in fees mounts up overtime, especially for long-term inverstors, taking away half or more of their total returns.<sup>3</sup> Furthermore, economic research has consistently documented that indexed funds have generally generated better returns for investors than actively managed funds. Inverstors have noticed, moving more of their money over time to indexed products: The share of all equity mutual funds that are indexed more than doubled from 1998 to 2012 (8.7 percent to 17.4 percent).<sup>4</sup> If one adds in the newer exchange-traded funds discussed next, indexed products accounted for fully one-third of both stock mutual funds and ETFs in 2013.<sup>5</sup>
  
  &emsp;There is one downside to indexing, however: Index funds or their shareholders have no incentive to monitor the managers of the companies that make up tthe index. or to exercise voice rather than exit, to use Hirschman's terminolog. But there are still many investors who can and do perform this monitoring function, so it is not clear how much of a loss of oversight the trend toward indexing has actually acused.
  
  &emsp;In the past two decades or so, the exchanged-traded fund (ETF) was developed by other financial entrepreneurs; it was modeled on the index qpproach that Bogle had pioneered. An index-based ETF essentially holds a fixed basket of stocks and trades lik a stock throughout th day, unlike a mutual fund, which reprices only at the end of each trading day. In addition, an ETF has tax advantages over a mutual fund, which passes through its gains and losses on a pro rata basis to shareholders, with the decision to sell or buy being made by the fund manager. In an ETF, that decision is made bu the ETF holder, who controls his or her own tax consequences.<sup>6</sup>
  
  &emsp;The ETF has made inroads into the institutional investment world for the above reasons, so much so that many mutual fund companies now offer ETF products themselves. Moreover, some innovators have designed ETFs whose stock holdings are actively managed. Still, as of 2012, assets held in ETFs accounted for only 9 percent of all assets managed by investment companies.<sup>7</sup>
  
  &emsp;What started then as a simple, but important economic insight from Harry Markowitz, elaborated by Samuelson, and popularized by Malkiel—that one gains superior returns given any level risk by diversiing an equity portfolio eventually transformed the investment world. 
  
  
#Efficient Markets and Their Implications 

  &emsp;It took an economist following an unlikely route to this subject to take the logic of index investing to the next theoretical level: If it makes sense to diversify, that must be because it is rare (see Warren Buffett), if impossible, to consistently outperform the market as a whole. 
  
  &emsp;Eugene Fan was that individual, and for his research work he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013 (see following box). Fama won the prize, for his development of the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH), which is one of the most cited, contentious, and often misunderstood propositions in economics. Nate Silver, the statis-tician and political forecaster (among other things), has done one of the best jobs I have seen translating the hypothesis into plain English and I will summarize his description here.<sup>8</sup>
  
  &emsp;EMH has a number of versions, each stronger then the next. In its weakest form, EMH postulates the findings just stated: Future stock price movements cannot be predicted from past statistical patterns.
  
  &emsp;The second, semi-strong version of EMH, is that trying to pick stocks that are undervalued—the kind of thing that Warren Buffett does remarkably well—is a sucker's game. All relevant information about the fundamental value of a company is instantaneously reflected in its stock price, so there is no room for investors or traders to consis-tently make money trying to guess which stocks will outperform the average, or won't.
  
  &emsp;How then can one explain Buffett's success (and that of a few others, like Peter Lynch, the famed investor who managed Fidelity's Vlagellan Fund in its early years for roughly two decades)? Fama's aswer, like that of other EM F-1 defenders, is luck. In any large number f coin-Rippers there inevitably will be a few who consistently pick which side of the coin comes out on top. But the winners clearly have no special insight into coin flipping. 
  
  &emsp;Buffett had a rejoinder to that answer, which he supplied in a famous debate he had at Columbia University in 1984 with another EMH defender, Harvard Business School professor (emeritus) Michael Jensen. The event celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the publica-tion of the bible of value investing, Graham and Dodd's The Intelligent Investor, which advocates an investment style that is the very antith-esis of EMH. After Jensen presented the coin-flipper analogy, Buffett replied by identifying nine other money managers who managed very different portfolios and yet had outstanding investment records. This result, he argued, could not be the result of random flips of the coin. 
  
  &emsp;The accounting of this exchange comes from Buffett's unoffi-cial and widely celebrated biography, Snowball, whose author, Alice Schroeder, reports that the audience applauded Buffett's answer.' And for what it's worth, most money managers side with Buffett; how could they not, for to embrace EMH would deny the value of their profes-sion, picking stocks?
  
  &emsp; Schroeder goes on to say, however, that EMH may still have pro-vided a valuable function by discouraging the average investor from managing his or her own money. In addition, she notes that there are now multiple versions of EMH that essentially say that EMH works for the most part, but not always.<sup>10</sup>
  
  &emsp;The third, strong form of EMH is that even traders with private information cannot consistently outperform the market. Silver states that not even most EMH supporters believe this extension of the theory. 
  
  &emsp;Silver also adds an important caveat to the three forms of EMH that Fama himself would insist on. Each applies only to risk-adjusted returns. Some investors willing to take above-average risks may be able to outperform the market, but only because of their risk taking, not because they have superior stock-picking ability. Their annual returns also will fluctuate more widely than a market-wide portfolio. 
  
  &emsp;EMH critics, and there are many, cite the stock market's sharp occasional falls as disproving the hypothesis. EMH defenders respond that market fluctuations do not refute the core proposition of the theory: namely, that no one can consistently outperform the market, except by taking more risk, or by chance. 

>##Eugene Farna 
Eugene Fama didn't start out wanting to be an economist when he enrolled in college at Tufts University. His first interest was in Romance languages, but like many who get turned on to some-thing else, Fama's life was changed after working as an assistant to a professor who ran a stock market forecasting service. 

>&emsp;Fama's work interested him in poring through past stock mar-ket data to discover patterns that might support a profitable invest-ment strategy The professor told him to test each strategy on a forward-looking basis, taking into account the costs of buying and selling the stocks—what economists call transactions costs—and as Nate Silver describes it, "almost always" the strategies failed.<sup>11</sup>

>&emsp;But the work and the hunting changed Fama's intellec-tual interests entirely. He abandoned any thought of pursu-ing Romance languages and instead went to the University of Chicago's business school to earn his PhD in finance (or what I have been calling financial economics). His dissertation focused on whether one could extrapolate the investment performance of mutual funds from their past performance (analogous to stock-picking exercises of his undergraduate years), based on data from the decade of the 1950s. 
  
>&emsp;Lo and behold, the striking answer was that one couldn't! Just because a fund had a good run in the past, an investor could not count on a continuation of that performance in the future. Fama also established the same result for the wide num-ber and variety of technical analysts—those who attempt to divine the future movement of stock prices from their past pat-terns charted on a graph. 
  
>&emsp;In short, Patna found that no one actively managing money, not even the best mutual fund managers, could con-sistently beat the market, or the performance turned in by an average of all stocks. 
  
>&emsp;In 2013, Farna was awarded the Nobel Prize for his pio-neering financial research. As discussed shortly in the text, he shared the prize with two other researchers. >

  &emsp;If picking stocks is a losing proposition, and indexing is the way to go, can anyone make money using the insights of EMH? The answer is yes, and one of the clearest examples is Dimensional Advisers, founded by one of Farna's former Chicago graduate students, David Booth. 
  
  &emsp;Booth got the idea for his company after being an adviser to pen-sion plans for large companies in the late 1970s, which then were heavily invested in large-capitalization stocks. He eventually wondered why these companies' treasurers were not also investing in small-cap stocks, or those of small or young public companies, as well. 
  
  &emsp;Booth didn't wait for the answer, or for anyone else to implement the idea. In 1981, he and a graduate school colleague, Rex Sinquefeld, launched Dimensional Advisers with the explicit objective of build-ing what was, in effect, an index fund of small-caps, even before such indices existed—in other words, the reverse of Vanguard's innovation of building the funds to replicate existing indices. Dimensional added value stocks, or those with low ratios of price to book value, to the mix of its portfolios for its investors. 
  
  &emsp;The EMH theory was not the only basis, however, for Dimensional's success. Booth and his colleagues introduced several important trading innovations, which the fund also credits for its suc-cess. One innovation was to buy stocks throughout the day, rather than only at the closing, when index funds are priced. This saved trading costs and enhanced the funds' performance. A second innovation was to parcel out orders to different brokers and tell them to be patient, and not to buy unless there was plenty of volume, or when many sell-ers were around. The founders did not want orders being executed when only a few sellers were able to command higher prices than in thicker markets. These instructions created competition among brokers for getting stock at the cheapest prices, which increased returns for Dimensional's fund investors.<sup>12</sup> 
  
  &emsp;This second practice has changed with the advent of high fre-quency trading, conducted by computers using trading algorithms for buying and selling stocks. Dimensional has adapted by developing its own ordering systems that bypass brokers. Later in the company's his-tory, Dimensional used the research findings of the company's aca-demic advisers (see box on David Booth that follows) to develop funds that invested in lame-can stocks,including companies in international markets, and fixed-income funds as well. As the firm's investment vehi-cles diversified, Dimensional broadened its marketing strategies, open-ing foreign offices and seeking funds from individuals with defined contribution pension plans. Dimensionars official history makes clear that its economic advisers were critical to each stage of the company's success and expansion. `3
  
>##David Booth: Putting EMH to Work 
##in the Investment World 
David Booth is one of the humblest billionaires you'll ever meet, and also a very generous one. I met him while we happened to be sitting next to each other on a shuttle bus ride at an event at Dallas several years ago. After introducing ourselves, and he said his name was David Booth, I thought a moment and then blurted out, "Are you the David Booth who just bought the Naismith papers (the original rules of basketball) and donated them to the University of Kansas?" He said yes. 

>&emsp;That question came to me because just before this bus ride, the Kansas City Star, the largest newspaper in the city where I was then living, had just reported the multimillion-dollar pur-chase of these papers by Booth and his donation. I also real-ized that he was the same Booth for whom the University of Chicago's Business School had been renamed after his very generous donation to the school where he received the train-ing in finance that ultimately led to his great success. 

>&emsp;Booth then briefly told me his life's story, how he had grown up in a modest house on Naismith Drive near the University of Kansas and why he had purchased and then donated the Naismith papers because of his love of basketball and the University of Kansas, which he attended as an under-graduate (both parts of his background resonated with me since I am a Kansas native, and a huge fan of the basketball teams of all Kansas universities). 

>&emsp;From Kansas, Booth went to Chicago's business school with the intention of earning his PhD in finance studying under Fama. Booth greatly enjoyed learning from Fama and served as his teaching assistant, but ultimately came to the conclusion that he was better suited for the investment world than academia. So he left Chicago before getting his PhD and entered the world of money management, first at Wells Fargo working on index funds, and later at A.G. Becker.

>&emsp;Booth credits his teacher Fama with the inspiration for his hugely successful entrepreneurial career in money manage¬ment. Fama, Kenneth French (another well-known financial economist at Dartmouth), and Robert Merton (another Nobel Prize winner), along with a handful of other academic stars in financial economics, are consultants to Dimensional, illustrating another important principle Booth explained to me: Start with a good idea but surround yourself with a lot of other people who are smarter than you to help implement it.<sup>14</sup>

#Behavioral Finance
  &emsp;The Nobel Prize for Economics has often gone to multiple economists in the same year. The year 2013 was one of those years, for not only did Gene Fama win for his work on EMH, but Robert Shiller ofYale University (see the following box) was a co-winner (along with Lars Hansen, Fama's colleague at the University of Chicago) for his work on financial economics, too. But what was relatively rare in this award is that Fama's and Shiner's research reached opposite conclusions.
  
  &emsp;Whereas Fama argues that financial asset prices are efficiently determined, Shiller was recognized by the Nobel committee for his research going back to the early 1980s showing that stock prices vary far more frequently than dividends,<sup>15</sup> suggesting stock prices can and do move for reasons that may have nothing to do with the fundamen¬tal earning power of their companies. This means that stock prices can overshoot in both directions, forming bubbles in good times (when,in Warren Buffett's terms, investors are greedy) and being excessively deflated in bad times (when Buffett says that investors are fearful). To Farna and other proponents of at least one of the stronger forms of EMH,  it makes no sense to talk of stock price bubbles because prices are always efficient.

  &emsp;Shiller was also in the vanguard of a school of financial economics called behavioral finance—a branch of a broader school of behavioral eco-nomics, discussed in the second chapter. Finance behaviorists, including not only many academics but also many professional and amateur stock pickers, believe there are too many ways in which stock price move¬ments depart from one or more versions of EMH. Thus, some investors and hedge funds buy and sell on momentum, believing they can predict stock prices over some future period (which may be much shorter than a day) based on past prices. Other investors have observed and acted on past oddities in stock pricing—such as the tendency that persisted for some time for stock prices to rise during the first week in January (after professional investors have sold off some stocks at year-end for tax or other reasons), or the apparent tendency of the worst perform¬ing stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the worst performing mutual funds to outperform the market as a whole for some period ahead.<sup>16</sup> Academic financial economists continue to debate the validity and importance of behavioral finance.

  &emsp;There is one proposition on which both Shiller and Fama very likely would agree, however: In the short run, stock prices are unpre-dictable and therefore it is prudent for most investors to buy and hold broad index-based instruments (mutual funds or ETFs). Shiller would be the first to tell the average investor that he or she cannot rely on some of the statistical oddities that some investigators may have found in the past that generated risk-adjusted returns, outperforming the market as a whole (what finance professionals call alpha). To this extent, then, Shiner's work provides just as much intellectual support for the indexing movement as does Fama's (Shiller would also argue, however, that in the long run it is fundamentals, namely the underlying earning power of companies, that determine stock prices and that suchprices revert to a long-run average of price-to-earnings ratios).

  &emsp;EMH proponents, meanwhile, deny that the oddities various behaviorists claim to have discovered are stable, largely because once they have been identified for all investors to see, enough may jump on the opportunities until at least some of the oddities disappear, or, in finance language, are arbitraged away. Shiller and other behaviorists may agree with this to some degree, but would add that market mis-alignments or hubbies can persist for some time before they are cor-rected or punctured, a proposition that EMH proponents would not accept.

  &emsp;Behavioral finance has important implications for policy makers, which is why the debate over its merits has an importance that extends beyond the world of investing. If it is true that financial markets are prone to manias and bubbles, as not only the behaviorists believe but as one of their intellectual godfathers, the late Hyman Minsky, argued in his many writings, then there is a case for preemptive government poli-cies aimed at thwarting these tendencies.

  &emsp;In the aftermath of the financial crisis, such policies have been called macro-prudential regulation, to distinguish them from the traditional micro regulation and supervision of individual financial institu-tions. Macro-prudential regulation was legitimized by the Dodd—Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which created an interagency committee (the Financial Stability Oversight Committee or FSOC) to monitor the economy for signs of bubbles in different asset markets and to take steps to keep them from growing too large. It will be quite a trick if regulators can pull this off, but the intellectual underpinnings of the effort clearly lie in behavioral finance.

>##Robert Shiner 
Robert Shiller is a native of Michigan, and earned his under-graduate degree from one of the state's flagship universities, the University of Michigan. His master's and PhD degrees in economics are from MIT, where he wrote his thesis on inter-est rate determination under the supervision of another Nobel laureate, Franco Modigliani. Shiner's Nobel came in 2013, as noted in the text.
