#Economists and Mostly Good Financial Engineering

  &emsp;We now come to the chapter about economists and finance. Given the bad reputation that the subject has earned in the wake of the financial crisis, l purposely delayed discussing it until I've put you in a better mood.
  
  &emsp;Seriously, economists, or actually financial economists, have made major contributions to our understanding of the way not only how the financial sector works, but also how the overall economy operates. Modern economies would not exit without modern financial sectors and systems, for finance is the lifeblood of all economies. When it works as it is supposed to, financial institutions and markets are not just abstract middleman, but essential institutions that enable people and firms to save and diversify their wealth. Just as clogged arteries and malfunctioning hearts can debilitate or kill people, finance gone wrong can do the same to economies. That is why financial engineering , in some quarters, no longer has the desirable connotations it once did. As an aside, most of those innovations that turned out wrong were not invented by economists, although many economists, including some famous and important ones, were late in realizing precisely how wrong they turned out to be.
  
  &emsp;In Chapter 12, l discuss a few ways in which economists have contributed to policy measures that have provided the platforms that have enabled or encouraged certain financial innovations or practices which l believe had positive economic effects.
  
  &emsp;This chapter is not about policy, however, but about financially related economic ideas that collectively have had major business implications. I will concentrate on three of the most important ones, as well as on the economists who thought them up, and a few of the business visionaries who put them to profitable, socially productive uses.
  

#Not Putting Your Eggs in One Basket:The Rise of Index Investing

  &emsp;If there is one adage that many investors have been told by their financial advisers, or by many books on investing, it is "Don't put all your eggs into one basket." In other words, do your best to diversify. True, this won't make you a killing, unless you make a lot of money from some other endeavor, save a lot of it, and then put that money into a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and some alternative assets (like real estate, or even gold). Then the laws of compound interest will take over, and if you live long enough, your wealth will be substantial.
  
  &emsp;There is a competing investment philosophy that is diametrically opposed to this bit of conventional wisdom. Attributed to a wide number of people, one of whom was Andrew Carnegie, the founder of U.S. Steel (Once a mighty industrial powerhouse), this notion is to concentrate on only one investment, and then watch that particular "basket" very carefully. I have heard this quote from some businessmen before, and frankly, it strikes me as much better advice for people engaged in business than those deciding how to invest someone's money.
  
  &emsp;Business calls for single-minded focus on what a firm and its employees do best. The national analogue to this notion is the principle of comparative advantage, probably one of the least understood and yet most important insights from economics. This principle says that nations (or firms or people) are best off if they concentrate on what they do best compared to others, even if they are absolutely better at doing a lot of things than others. The principle implies that businesses are thus better off if they are focused on just one or a few things.
  
  &emsp;Investing is different. One can earn more and take less risk overall by diversifying. But what is the optimal amount of diversification? That was a question that Harry Markowitz asked in the earlier 1950s. His answer, roughly 20 to 30 stocks, and the methodology he used to derive it, earned him a Nobel Prize in 1990. Several years earlier, in 1981, Yale economist James Tobin (One of my graduate school mentors and favorite teachers and people) also won the Nobel Prize for related work.
  
  &emsp;Some ideas win Nobel Prizes while others become popularized, either by journalists or other economists. The notion that portfolio diversification is the best way to invest in the market provides such an example. When investors think of the concept, the individual who most often comes to mind is neither Markowitz nor Tobin, but longtime Princeton economics professor and frequent op-ed columnist Burton Malkiel, who penned one of the most famous popular books about investing, *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*. Originally published in 1973, the book has since had 10 editions.<sup>1</sup>
  
  &emsp;Ideas can have real-world commercial impacts in many different ways. Sometimes, entrepreneurs and executives at established firms read a book or an article with a clever idea and they proceed to make it operational. Others get commercial ideas from economists they hires as consultants. And frequently, as you will see in this book, entrepreneurs are motivated by an economic idea they learn while attending school.
  
  &emsp;John "Jack" Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard family of mutual funds, is a prime example of the last way economists have had an impact. Bogle reports that he was heavily influenced by both Malkiel and Paul Samuelson (profiled in Chapter 2), two of the champions of indexing and critics of active money management, especially by individual investors, both in writing his senior thesis at Princeton on the idea of index fund and then actually implementing that idea at Vanguard.<sup>2</sup>In 1976, the firm launched its S&P index fund, shortly after Malkiel published his first edition of *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*.

  &emsp;The rest, as they say, is history. Not only did Vanguard go on to sponsor funds based on other indicates, but other funds copied Vanguard's model and did the same and then some. Eventually, numerous mutual funds offered all kinds of sector-specific funds, each with its own index.
  
  &emsp;It is difficult to overstate the important of the indexing revolution in the mutual fund business, which up to Bogle's time operated entirely through funds that were actively managed by stock pickers, and accordingly charged comparatively larger management fees (typically 1 percent or more of the assets of the fund each year) than index funds (where the fees tend to fall in the range of 10 to 20 basis points, or 0.1 to 0.2 percent of assets). Bogle has shown in his extensive writings how this difference in fees mounts up overtime, especially for long-term investors, taking away half or more of their total returns.<sup>3</sup> Furthermore, economic research has consistently documented that indexed funds have generally generated better returns for investors than actively managed funds. Investors have noticed, moving more of their money over time to indexed products: The share of all equity mutual funds that are indexed more than doubled from 1998 to 2012 (8.7 percent to 17.4 percent).<sup>4</sup> If one adds in the newer exchange-traded funds discussed next, indexed products accounted for fully one-third of both stock mutual funds and ETFs in 2013.<sup>5</sup>
  
  &emsp;There is one downside to indexing, however: Index funds or their shareholders have no incentive to monitor the managers of the companies that make up the index. or to exercise voice rather than exit, to use Hirschman's terminology. But there are still many investors who can and do perform this monitoring function, so it is not clear how much of a loss of oversight the trend toward indexing has actually accused.
  
  &emsp;In the past two decades or so, the exchanged-traded fund (ETF) was developed by other financial entrepreneurs; it was modeled on the index approach that Bogle had pioneered. An index-based ETF essentially holds a fixed basket of stocks and trades like a stock throughout the day, unlike a mutual fund, which reprices only at the end of each trading day. In addition, an ETF has tax advantages over a mutual fund, which passes through its gains and losses on a pro rata basis to shareholders, with the decision to sell or buy being made by the fund manager. In an ETF, that decision is made by the ETF holder, who controls his or her own tax consequences.<sup>6</sup>
  
  &emsp;The ETF has made inroads into the institutional investment world for the above reasons, so much so that many mutual fund companies now offer ETF products themselves. Moreover, some innovators have designed ETFs whose stock holdings are actively managed. Still, as of 2012, assets held in ETFs accounted for only 9 percent of all assets managed by investment companies.<sup>7</sup>
  
  &emsp;What started then as a simple, but important economic insight from Harry Markowitz, elaborated by Samuelson, and popularized by Malkielâ€”that one gains superior returns given any level risk by diversifying an equity portfolio eventually transformed the investment world. 
  
  
#Efficient Markets and Their Implications 

  &emsp;It took an economist following an unlikely route to this subject to take the logic of index investing to the next theoretical level: If it makes sense to diversify, that must be because it is rare (see Warren Buffett), if impossible, to consistently outperform the market as a whole. 
  
  &emsp;Eugene Fama was that individual, and for his research work he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2013 (see following box). Fama won the prize, for his development of the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH), which is one of the most cited, contentious, and often misunderstood propositions in economics. Nate Silver, the statistician and political forecaster (among other things), has done one of the best jobs I have seen translating the hypothesis into plain English and I will summarize his description here.<sup>8</sup>
  
  &emsp;EMH has a number of versions, each stronger then the next. In its weakest form, EMH postulates the findings just stated: Future stock price movements cannot be predicted from past statistical patterns.
  
  &emsp;The second, semi-strong version of EMH, is that trying to pick stocks that are undervaluedâ€”the kind of thing that Warren Buffett does remarkably wellâ€”is a sucker's game. All relevant information about the fundamental value of a company is instantaneously reflected in its stock price, so there is no room for investors or traders to consistently make money trying to guess which stocks will outperform the average, or won't.
  
  &emsp;How then can one explain Buffett's success (and that of a few others, like Peter Lynch, the famed investor who managed Fidelity's Magellan Fund in its early years for roughly two decades)? Fama's answer, like that of other EMF defenders, is luck. In any large number of coin-flippers there inevitably will be a few who consistently pick which side of the coin comes out on top. But the winners clearly have no special insight into coin flipping. 
  
  &emsp;Buffett had a rejoinder to that answer, which he supplied in a famous debate he had at Columbia University in 1984 with another EMH defender, Harvard Business School professor (emeritus) Michael Jensen. The event celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the bible of value investing, Graham and Dodd's The Intelligent Investor, which advocates an investment style that is the very antithesis of EMH. After Jensen presented the coin-flipper analogy, Buffett replied by identifying nine other money managers who managed very different portfolios and yet had outstanding investment records. This result, he argued, could not be the result of random flips of the coin. 
  
  &emsp;The accounting of this exchange comes from Buffett's unofficial and widely celebrated biography, Snowball, whose author, Alice Schroeder, reports that the audience applauded Buffett's answer.' And for what it's worth, most money managers side with Buffett; how could they not, for to embrace EMH would deny the value of their profession, picking stocks?
  
  &emsp; Schroeder goes on to say, however, that EMH may still have provided a valuable function by discouraging the average investor from managing his or her own money. In addition, she notes that there are now multiple versions of EMH that essentially say that EMH works for the most part, but not always.<sup>10</sup>
  
  &emsp;The third, strong form of EMH is that even traders with private information cannot consistently outperform the market. Silver states that not even most EMH supporters believe this extension of the theory. 
  
  &emsp;Silver also adds an important caveat to the three forms of EMH that Fama himself would insist on. Each applies only to risk-adjusted returns. Some investors willing to take above-average risks may be able to outperform the market, but only because of their risk taking, not because they have superior stock-picking ability. Their annual returns also will fluctuate more widely than a market-wide portfolio. 
  
  &emsp;EMH critics, and there are many, cite the stock market's sharp occasional falls as disproving the hypothesis. EMH defenders respond that market fluctuations do not refute the core proposition of the theory: namely, that no one can consistently outperform the market, except by taking more risk, or by chance. 

>##Eugene Fama 
Eugene Fama didn't start out wanting to be an economist when he enrolled in college at Tufts University. His first interest was in Romance languages, but like many who get turned on to something else, Fama's life was changed after working as an assistant to a professor who ran a stock market forecasting service. 

>&emsp;Fama's work interested him in poring through past stock market data to discover patterns that might support a profitable investment strategy The professor told him to test each strategy on a forwardlooking basis, taking into account the costs of buying and selling the stocksâ€”what economists call transactions costsâ€”and as Nate Silver describes it, "almost always" the strategies failed.<sup>11</sup>

>&emsp;But the work and the hunting changed Fama's intellectual interests entirely. He abandoned any thought of pursuing Romance languages and instead went to the University of Chicago's business school to earn his PhD in finance (or what I have been calling financial economics). His dissertation focused on whether one could extrapolate the investment performance of mutual funds from their past performance (analogous to stock-picking exercises of his undergraduate years), based on data from the decade of the 1950s. 
  
>&emsp;Lo and behold, the striking answer was that one couldn't! Just because a fund had a good run in the past, an investor could not count on a continuation of that performance in the future. Fama also established the same result for the wide number and variety of technical analystsâ€”those who attempt to divine the future movement of stock prices from their past patterns charted on a graph. 
  
>&emsp;In short, Patna found that no one actively managing money, not even the best mutual fund managers, could consistently beat the market, or the performance turned in by an average of all stocks. 
  
>&emsp;In 2013, Farna was awarded the Nobel Prize for his pioneering financial research. As discussed shortly in the text, he shared the prize with two other researchers.

  &emsp;If picking stocks is a losing proposition, and indexing is the way to go, can anyone make money using the insights of EMH? The answer is yes, and one of the clearest examples is Dimensional Advisers, founded by one of Farna's former Chicago graduate students, David Booth. 
  
  &emsp;Booth got the idea for his company after being an adviser to pension plans for large companies in the late 1970s, which then were heavily invested in largecapitalization stocks. He eventually wondered why these companies' treasurers were not also investing in smallcap stocks, or those of small or young public companies, as well. 
  
  &emsp;Booth didn't wait for the answer, or for anyone else to implement the idea. In 1981, he and a graduate school colleague, Rex Sinquefeld, launched Dimensional Advisers with the explicit objective of building what was, in effect, an index fund of small-caps, even before such indices existedâ€”in other words, the reverse of Vanguard's innovation of building the funds to replicate existing indices. Dimensional added value stocks, or those with low ratios of price to book value, to the mix of its portfolios for its investors. 
  
  &emsp;The EMH theory was not the only basis, however, for Dimensional's success. Booth and his colleagues introduced several important trading innovations, which the fund also credits for its success. One innovation was to buy stocks throughout the day, rather than only at the closing, when index funds are priced. This saved trading costs and enhanced the funds' performance. A second innovation was to parcel out orders to different brokers and tell them to be patient, and not to buy unless there was plenty of volume, or when many sellers were around. The founders did not want orders being executed when only a few sellers were able to command higher prices than in thicker markets. These instructions created competition among brokers for getting stock at the cheapest prices, which increased returns for Dimensional's fund investors.<sup>12</sup> 
  
  &emsp;This second practice has changed with the advent of high frequency trading, conducted by computers using trading algorithms for buying and selling stocks. Dimensional has adapted by developing its own ordering systems that bypass brokers. Later in the company's history, Dimensional used the research findings of the company's academic advisers (see box on David Booth that follows) to develop funds that invested in lamecan stocks,including companies in international markets, and fixed-income funds as well. As the firm's investment vehicles diversified, Dimensional broadened its marketing strategies, opening foreign offices and seeking funds from individuals with defined contribution pension plans. Dimensionars official history makes clear that its economic advisers were critical to each stage of the company's success and expansion. <sup>13</sup> 
  
>##David Booth: Putting EMH to Work in the Investment World 
David Booth is one of the humblest billionaires you'll ever meet, and also a very generous one. I met him while we happened to be sitting next to each other on a shuttle bus ride at an event at Dallas several years ago. After introducing ourselves, and he said his name was David Booth, I thought a moment and then blurted out, "Are you the David Booth who just bought the Naismith papers (the original rules of basketball) and donated them to the University of Kansas?" He said yes. 

>&emsp;That question came to me because just before this bus ride, the Kansas City Star, the largest newspaper in the city where I was then living, had just reported the multimillion-dollar purchase of these papers by Booth and his donation. I also realized that he was the same Booth for whom the University of Chicago's Business School had been renamed after his very generous donation to the school where he received the training in finance that ultimately led to his great success. 

>&emsp;Booth then briefly told me his life's story, how he had grown up in a modest house on Naismith Drive near the University of Kansas and why he had purchased and then donated the Naismith papers because of his love of basketball and the University of Kansas, which he attended as an undergraduate (both parts of his background resonated with me since I am a Kansas native, and a huge fan of the basketball teams of all Kansas universities). 

>&emsp;From Kansas, Booth went to Chicago's business school with the intention of earning his PhD in finance studying under Fama. Booth greatly enjoyed learning from Fama and served as his teaching assistant, but ultimately came to the conclusion that he was better suited for the investment world than academia. So he left Chicago before getting his PhD and entered the world of money management, first at Wells Fargo working on index funds, and later at A.G. Becker.

>&emsp;Booth credits his teacher Fama with the inspiration for his hugely successful entrepreneurial career in money management. Fama, Kenneth French (another well-known financial economist at Dartmouth), and Robert Merton (another Nobel Prize winner), along with a handful of other academic stars in financial economics, are consultants to Dimensional, illustrating another important principle Booth explained to me: Start with a good idea but surround yourself with a lot of other people who are smarter than you to help implement it.<sup>14</sup>

#Behavioral Finance
  &emsp;The Nobel Prize for Economics has often gone to multiple economists in the same year. The year 2013 was one of those years, for not only did Gene Fama win for his work on EMH, but Robert Shiller ofYale University (see the following box) was a co-winner (along with Lars Hansen, Fama's colleague at the University of Chicago) for his work on financial economics, too. But what was relatively rare in this award is that Fama's and Shiner's research reached opposite conclusions.
  
  &emsp;Whereas Fama argues that financial asset prices are efficiently determined, Shiller was recognized by the Nobel committee for his research going back to the early 1980s showing that stock prices vary far more frequently than dividends,<sup>15</sup> suggesting stock prices can and do move for reasons that may have nothing to do with the fundamental earning power of their companies. This means that stock prices can overshoot in both directions, forming bubbles in good times (when,in Warren Buffett's terms, investors are greedy) and being excessively deflated in bad times (when Buffett says that investors are fearful). To Farna and other proponents of at least one of the stronger forms of EMH,  it makes no sense to talk of stock price bubbles because prices are always efficient.

  &emsp;Shiller was also in the vanguard of a school of financial economics called behavioral financeâ€”a branch of a broader school of behavioral economics, discussed in the second chapter. Finance behaviorists, including not only many academics but also many professional and amateur stock pickers, believe there are too many ways in which stock price movements depart from one or more versions of EMH. Thus, some investors and hedge funds buy and sell on momentum, believing they can predict stock prices over some future period (which may be much shorter than a day) based on past prices. Other investors have observed and acted on past oddities in stock pricingâ€”such as the tendency that persisted for some time for stock prices to rise during the first week in January (after professional investors have sold off some stocks at year-end for tax or other reasons), or the apparent tendency of the worst performing stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the worst performing mutual funds to outperform the market as a whole for some period ahead.<sup>16</sup> Academic financial economists continue to debate the validity and importance of behavioral finance.

  &emsp;There is one proposition on which both Shiller and Fama very likely would agree, however: In the short run, stock prices are unpredictable and therefore it is prudent for most investors to buy and hold broad indexbased instruments (mutual funds or ETFs). Shiller would be the first to tell the average investor that he or she cannot rely on some of the statistical oddities that some investigators may have found in the past that generated risk-adjusted returns, outperforming the market as a whole (what finance professionals call alpha). To this extent, then, Shiner's work provides just as much intellectual support for the indexing movement as does Fama's (Shiller would also argue, however, that in the long run it is fundamentals, namely the underlying earning power of companies, that determine stock prices and that such prices revert to a long-run average of price-to-earnings ratios).

  &emsp;EMH proponents, meanwhile, deny that the oddities various behaviorists claim to have discovered are stable, largely because once they have been identified for all investors to see, enough may jump on the opportunities until at least some of the oddities disappear, or, in finance language, are arbitraged away. Shiller and other behaviorists may agree with this to some degree, but would add that market misalignments or bubbles can persist for some time before they are corrected or punctured, a proposition that EMH proponents would not accept.

  &emsp;Behavioral finance has important implications for policy makers, which is why the debate over its merits has an importance that extends beyond the world of investing. If it is true that financial markets are prone to manias and bubbles, as not only the behaviorists believe but as one of their intellectual godfathers, the late Hyman Minsky, argued in his many writings, then there is a case for preemptive government policies aimed at thwarting these tendencies.

  &emsp;In the aftermath of the financial crisis, such policies have been called macro-prudential regulation, to distinguish them from the traditional micro regulation and supervision of individual financial institutions. Macro-prudential regulation was legitimized by the Doddâ€”Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which created an interagency committee (the Financial Stability Oversight Committee or FSOC) to monitor the economy for signs of bubbles in different asset markets and to take steps to keep them from growing too large. It will be quite a trick if regulators can pull this off, but the intellectual underpinnings of the effort clearly lie in behavioral finance.

>##Robert Shiller 
Robert Shiller is a native of Michigan, and earned his undergraduate degree from one of the state's flagship universities, the University of Michigan. His master's and PhD degrees in economics are from MIT, where he wrote his thesis on interest rate determination under the supervision of another Nobel laureate, Franco Modigliani. Shiner's Nobel came in 2013, as noted in the text.

>&emsp;Ironically, Shiller is one of the few economists of recent years who was widely known even before he won the prize. That is because Shiller predicted the deflation of not one, but two asset bubbles. His widely popular book, Irrational Exuberance, which focused on the excesses in the stock market, was published in March 2000, or just one month before stock prices, especially those of newly public Internet companies, crashed. Later in the decade, but well before housing prices began to turn down in 2006 and 2007, Shiller presciently warned in both writing and in media appearances of an emerging bubble in residential real estate prices, fueled by the excessively liberal extension of subprime mortgages.

>&emsp;Shiller is not your typical ivory tower economist. He has long displayed a strong interest in applying his ideas to the real world. One of his best-known endeavors is his partnership with Wellesley economist Carl Case in forming and publishing the Caseâ€”Shiller index of residential real estate prices, which was purchased and is being maintained by Standard & Poor's. Unlike other such indices, which report average prices of all homes sold within a given time period and geographic area, Caseâ€”Shiller follows the prices of the same homes in 20 cities around the country and thus doesn't change when the mix of lower and higher priced homes changes.

#Valuing Options: Upsides and Downsides
&emsp;This book began with the observation that economists suffered a hit to their prestige on account of the financial crisis of 2007 to 2008 and the subsequent Great Recession. In many popular accounts, financial derivatives played an important role in these events and, by implication, derivatives have taken on the characteristics of an unprintable (at least in this kind of book) four-letter word.

&emsp;I address derivatives in more detail in Chapter 12, which discusses the impact of economists on policies affecting the financial sector.

&emsp;Here, I want to discuss both the positive and not-so-positive impacts that one economic advance relating to particular derivative, the tradable financial option contract, has had on the financial industry, and business more broadly.

&emsp;An option is just one form of a derivative, or a financial instrument whose value is derived from the value of some other more fundamental financial contract. For example, a futures contract is one that requires the holder to buy or sell a particular commodity, or more recently an index of stocks, at a particular price before the end of some time period (typically six months). In contrast, an option contract simply gives the holder the right to buy or sell that instrumentâ€”let's use a stockâ€”at a given price before some maturity date. An option to buy is a call and an option to sell is a put. The price at which the option is exercised is called the strike price.

&emsp;For example, consider IBM selling at $200 per share. An investor could buy a range of calls at different strike prices, from below $200 (in which case the option is said to be in the money because the market price is above the strike price) to well above $200 (in which case the option is out of the money). You would buy a call if you thought IBM's price was going up. If you did this because you had shorted IBM (bet against it), you would be hedging that position (since the gains on the option if IBM's price increase would be offset by your loss on the short). If you bought the call simply because you wanted to bet on IBM's stock price increasing but didn't want to sell out the full $200 per share, then you'd be speculating.

&emsp;Options also allow purchasers to take advantage of leverage, since the price of an IBM option with a strike price of $210 may be $5 a share, which may double if IBM's market price rises by $5. In contrast, a $5 increase in a stock with a base price of $200 would represent only a 2.5 percent gain (5/200). Better yet, the option limits your downside loss, which is only the cost of the option itself. In effect, an option is like paying an insurance premium for a limited time on the value of a stock.

&emsp;I ran through this example for a call, but the same analysis applies, in reverse, to put options, which purchasers would buy if they thought the price of stock was going to fall. As with calls, purchasers could buy a put as a hedge or for speculative reasons.

>##Speculation: A Practice Much Misunderstood
Some readers may see the word speculation and immediately have a negative gut reaction. After all, weren't speculators somehow responsible for the financial crisis? And don't speculators add to market volatility, which somehow is bad for the market?

>&emsp;There is an abundant literature in economics journals on the virtues and drawbacks of speculators, but on the whole, financial economists support the presence of speculators (some call them noise traders as opposed to fundamental traders) for at least two reasons:

>&emsp;1.Hedgers need someone to take the other sides of their trades, and there may not be equivalent volumes of offsetting hedgers to do this; speculators are essential to fill the gap.

>&emsp;2.Speculators add volume to the market for any financial instrument, which makes them more liquidâ€”that is, easier to buy or sell without moving the price.


&emsp;Although options have traded for hundreds of years in other locales, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) was the first exchange authorized to trade financial options in the United States, opening for business in April 1973. Not coincidentally, two financial economists, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, some months before had developed an options pricing formula that traders would be able to use easily to make informed purchase and sale decisions. The Black-Scholes paper was published shortly after the CBOE opened.<sup>17</sup> At around the same time, Texas Instruments introduced a pocket calculator that had the Black-Scholes pricing formula embedded in it.<sup>18</sup> Later, Robert Merton published a paper generalizing the Black-Scholes result.<sup>19</sup>

&emsp;The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) Options pricing formula has since become one of the most widely used formulas in economics, used by traders at banks, hedge funds, nonbank firms, and other financial institutions around the world. Two of the developers of the formula, Scholes and Merton, received the Nobel Prize in 1997 for their work.

&emsp;The prize is not without controversy, however, on two counts. One reason is that two hedge fund traders, Ed Thorp and Sheen Kassouf, had earlier developed and used a proprietary formula for pricing warrants, which are options to buy stock that were then (and still are) issued with other securities, such as convertible bonds (bonds that can be converted to stock). The Thorp-Kassouf formula was similar to the one developed by Black and Scholes, but was not made public in the form of an academic journal article (although a trading strategy relating to their formula had been published elsewhere).<sup>20</sup>

&emsp;Second and coincidentally less than a year after Scholes and Merton received their Nobelâ€”Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), large hedge fund in which Scholes and Merton had been partners, collapsed and had to be rescued (at the instigation of the Federal Reserve) by its bank creditors.<sup>21</sup> The fund collapsed largely because its founders assumed that extremely unlikely events precipitated by the 1997 financial crisis in Russia or so-called *tail risk* could not occur, but in fact did.

&emsp;Still, neither the prior work by Thorp nor the LTCM debacle can detract from the importance of the BSM breakthrough. It is widely understood that the options marketâ€”where today options on a range of financial instruments are traded on multiple platforms around the worldâ€”would not have developed as rapidly and deeply as it did had the BSM equation not been invented and widely publicized (and not held closely as the proprietary tool of one hedge fund).

&emsp;Although the BSM formula itself is complicated (and can be found not only in the original articles but in financial economics textbooks),<sup>22</sup> with the advent of pocket calculators and later apps for personal and tablet computers, any trader can easily use it to figure out what price to bid or ask for an option simply by punching in a few key known or easily estimated parameters: the disparity between the current market price of the underlying financial instrument on which the option is written (say, a stock or a stock index) and the strike price; how volatile the stock historically has been; the time left before the Option expires (its current maturity); and the interest rate for borrowing funds.

&emsp;Here's the intuition behind each of these parameters, each holding the other factors constant. For example, an option is worth more the closer the market price is to the strike price, the more volatile the movements are in the underlying stock price (making it more worthwhile to invest in the option), the more time is left to exercise the option, and the lower the interest rate (which, among other things, measures the money foregone by not investing in an alternative asset).

&emsp;The original Black-Scholes equation used a number of unrealistic assumptions. Merton later revised the equation and removed some of the assumptions. But the BSM model is still not perfect: Most notably, it underestimates extreme moves in the markets, of the kind that upended LTCM (tail risk, again), and incorrectly assumes that transactions are costless (though the costs have come down hugely since the equation was first published, largely due to the deregulation of brokerage commissions, discussed in Chapter 12). Even with these limitations, traders continue to use it as they widely view the BSM model as a surficient approximation of the true value of an option.

&emsp;The easy pricing of options made possible by the BSM model has had major effects, both welcome and unwelcome, on the real economy outside of Wall Street and Chicago where options and their underlying financial instruments are traded.

&emsp;Let's take the good part first: the positive impact of stock options on the formation and growth of new companies. All new companies have the common challenge of conserving cash. This is true even for the fortunate few that receive seed financing from one or more angel investors, or even more rarely, from a venture capital firm. Outside financiers want founders to do everything to conserve cash, especially cash they provide in return for shares in the company.

&emsp;Worried about drawing down their cash reserves, founders of new companies turn to stock options as a way of partially compensating new employees, whom they will need, at sonic point, to make their companies grow. From the vantage of the founders, options are better than giving stock outright (even if its sale is restricted), since the options will only be exercised if the company does well (depending on the strike price), and meanwhile the founders will not have given up equity ownership slices of their companies (diluting their shares or those of their investors). From the employees' vantage, the options are like long-shot tickets in horse racing: If they pay off, they can bring riches.

&emsp;Although publicly held companies have granted their senior executives, and in some cases other employees, stock options for some time, they became a dramatically more important component of compensation after Congress, at the request of the Clinton Administration, denied companies the ability to deduct as expenses for tax purposes executive salaries in excess of $1 million. As often happens with legislation with good intentions this one aimed at narrowing the widening disparity between compensation paid to top managers and other employees of publicly held companiesâ€”this particular proposal had some undesirable unintended consequences, which illustrate the down-side of the increased use of options.

&emsp;In particular, with companies no longer allowed to deduct high salaries as expenses, they were incentivized to accept demands by top executives for stock options in lieu of cash above the $1 million cap. From a tax point of view, this was ideal for the executives, since the tax rate on any capital gains from an increase in their company's stock price was considerably lower than the highest marginal tax rate on salary income. Even better, the executives didn't have to pay even the lower capital gains taxes until they exercised their options, which could be years away. Options also benefited the companies issuing them, because, for financial reporting purposes at the time, options were not recognized as an expense until they were exercised.

&emsp;The problem with large option grants, however, was that they unintentionally gave some unscrupulous executives incentives to have their companies take big risks, or even to engage in accounting tricks, in order to goose the prices of the companies' stocks so that the executives could cash in their options with big gains. Because the options were just thatâ€”a right to buy stock at a potentially discounted price at a later pointâ€”they carried very limited downside risk. The worst the executives could suffer if their bets turned sour was to lose the value of the option.

&emsp;Unfortunately, the potential downside to options was realized in the
late 1990s and early 2000s when it was revealed that top executives of Enron, Worldcom, and Tyco, among other companies, cooked their companies' books and eventually led them into actual or near bankruptcy. Along the way, the executives cashed in bundles of stock options.

&emsp;While it is impossible to prove cause and effect, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that at least for some executives who may have been predisposed to engaging in or encouraging deceptive accounting, the incentives provided by stock options could have been the decisive factor tipping them to actually do it.<sup>23</sup>

&emsp;The corporate accounting misdeeds landed a number of the executives in jail for fraud, while spurring the enactment of sweeping legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that subjected publicly held companies, their executives, directors, and accountants to a new set of corporate governance standards and other requirements that remain controversial to this day. Several years later, after a bruising quasi-political campaign, the official American and
international bodies that set accounting standards changed the rules governing the reporting of options and required companies to record the value of options as an expense at the time they are granted, using the best methods available for that purpose. The BSM formula is one such method.

#The Bottom Line

&emsp;The ideas of economists, or a subset of them known as finance specialists, have had a powerful impact on the world of finance, and the firms engaged in the business. The indexed financial products business owes its origins to, or at least was accelerated by, the ideas of financial economists. The efficient markets hypothesis has found practical application in the world of investing, even though many money managers reject it, believing their stock picking can outperform the market. Also, some money managers and hedge funds engage in some form of momentum trading, a fact that behaviorists would cite to support their view of financial markets. It is not clear, however, what specific impacts academic behavioral finance specialists have had on the world of investing.

&emsp;Finally, financial economists played a huge role in facilitating the rise of options trading and had an important influence on the use of options as employee compensation. This was more clearly a positive development for startups than it has been for established public companies.
