#Economists and Mostly Good Financial Engineering

  &emsp;We now come to the chapter about economists and finance. Given the bad reputation that the subject has earned in the wake of the financial crisis, l purposely delayed discussing it until l've put you in a better mood.
  
  &emsp;Seriously, economists, or actually financial economists, have made major contributions to our understanding of the way not only how the financial sector works, but also how the overall economy operates. Modern economies would not exit without modern financial sectors and systems, for finance is the lifeblood of all economies. When it works as it is supposed to, financial institutions and markets are not just abstract middleman, but essential institutions that enable people and firms to save and diversify their wealth. Just as clogged arteries and malfunctioning hearts can debilitate or kill people, finance gone wrong can do the sanmeto economies. That is why financial engineering , in some quarters, no longer has the desirable connotations it once did. As an aside, most of those innovations that turned out wrong were not invented by economists, although many economists, including some famous and important ones, were late in realizing percisely how wrong they turned out to be.
  
  &emsp;In Chapter 12, l discuss a few ways in which economists have contributed to policy measures that have provided the platforms that have enabled or encouraged certain financial innovations or practices which l believe had positive economic effects.
  
  &emsp;This chapter is not about policy, however, but about financially related economic ideas that collectively have had major business implications. I will concentrate on three of the most improtant ones, as well as on the economists who thought them up, and a few of the business visionaries who put them to profitable, socially productive uses.
  

#Not Putting Your Eggs in One Basket:The Rise of Index Inversting

  &emsp;If there is one adage that many investors have been told by their financial advisers, or by many books on investing, it is "Don't put all your eggs into one basket." In other words, do your best to diversify. True, this won't make you a killing, unless you make a lot of money from some other endeavor, save a lot of it, and then put that money into a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and some alternative assets (like real estate, or even gold). Then the laws of compound interest will take over, and if you live long enough, your wealth will be substantial.
  
  &emsp;There is a competing investment philosophy that is diametrically opposed to this bit of conventional wisdom. Attributed to a wide number of people, one of whom was Andrew Carnegie, the founder of U.S. Steel (Once a mighty industrial powerhouse), this notion is to concentrate on only one investment, and then watch that particular "basket" very carefully. I have heard this quote from some businessmen before, and frankly, it strikes me as much better advice for people engaged in business than those deciding how to invest someone's money.
  
  &emsp;Business calls for single-minded focus on what a firm and its employees do best. The national analogue to this notion is the principleof comparative advantage, probably one of the least understood and yet most important insights from economics. This principle says that nations (or firms or people) are best off if they concentrate on what they do best compared to others, even if they are absolutely better at doing a lot of things than others. The principle implies that businesses are thus better off if they are focused on just one or a few things.
  
  &emsp;Investing is different. One can earn more and take less risk overall bu diversifying. But what is the optimal amount of diversification? That was a question that Harry Markowitz asked in the earlier 1950s. His answer, roughly 20 to 30 stocks, and the methodology he used to derive it, earned him a Nobel Prize in 1990. Several years earlier, in 1981, Yale economist James Tobin (One of my graduate school mentors and favorite teachers and people) also won the Nobel Prize for related work.
  
  &emsp;Some ideas win Nobel Prizes whlie others become popularized, either by journalists or other economists. The notion that portfolio diversification is the best way to invest in the market provides such an example. When investors think of the concept, the individual who most often comes to mind is neither Markowitz nor Tobin, but longtime Princeton economics professor and frequent op-ed columnist Burton Malkiel, who penned one of the most famous popular books about investing, *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*. Originally published in 1973, the book has since had 10 editions.<sup>1</sup>
  
  &emsp;Ideas can have real-world commercial impacts in many different ways. Sometimes, entrepreneurs and executives at established firms read a book or an article with a clever idea and they proceed to make it operational. Others get commercial ideas from economists they hires as consultants. And frequently, as you will see in this book, entrepreneurs are motivated by an economic idea they learn while attending school.
  
  &emsp;John "Jack" Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard family of mutual funds, is a prime example of the last way economists have had an impact. Bogle reports that he was heavily influenced by both Malkiel and Paul Samuelson (profiled in Chapter 2), two of the champions of indexing and critics of active money management, especiallybu individual investors, both in writing his senior thesis at Princetion on the idea of index fund and then actually implementing that idea at Vanguard.<sup>2</sup>In 1976, the firm launched its S&P index fund, shortly after Malkiel published his first edition of *A Random Walk Down Wall Street*.

  &emsp;The rest, as they say, is history. Not only did Vanguard go on to sponsor funds based on other indices, but other funds copied Vanguard's model and did the same and then some. Eventually, numerous mutual funds offered all kinds of sector-specific funds, each with its own index.
  
  &emsp;It is difficult to overstate the important of the indexing revolution in the mutual fund business, which up tp Bogle's time operated entirely through funds that were actively managed bu stock pickers, and accordingly charged comparatively larger management fees (typically 1 percent or more of the assets of the fund each year) than index funds (where the fees tend to fall in the range of 10 to 20 basis points, or 0.1 to 0.2 percent of assets). Bogle has shown in his extensive writings how this difference in fees mounts up overtime, especially for long-term inverstors, taking away half or more of their total returns.<sup>3</sup> Furthermore, economic research has consistently documented that indexed funds have generally generated better returns for investors than actively managed funds. Inverstors have noticed, moving more of their money over time to indexed products: The share of all equity mutual funds that are indexed more than doubled from 1998 to 2012 (8.7 percent to 17.4 percent).<sup>4</sup> If one adds in the newer exchange-traded funds discussed next, indexed products accounted for fully one-third of both stock mutual funds and ETFs in 2013.<sup>5</sup>
  &emsp;There is one downside to indexing, however: Index funds or their shareholders have no incentive to monitor the managers of the companies that make up tthe index. or to exercise voice rather than exit, to use Hirschman's terminolog. But there are still many investors who can and do perform this monitoring function, so it is not clear how much of a loss of oversight the trend toward indexing has actually acused.
  &emsp;In the past two decades or so, the exchanged-traded fund (ETF) was developed by other financial entrepreneurs; it was modeled on the index qpproach that Bogle had pioneered. An index-based ETF essentially holds a fixed basket of stocks and trades lik a stock throughout th day, unlike a mutual fund, which reprices only at the end of each trading day. In addition, an ETF has tax advantages over a mutual fund, which passes through its gains and losses on a pro rata basis to shareholders, with the decision to sell or buy being made by the fund manager. In an ETF, that decision is made bu the ETF holder, who controls his or her own tax consequences.<sup>6</sup>
